Importance of Organizing Variables
Organizing variables is important for:

Readability, Maintainability, Efficiency

2. (type1 == 'L') || (type1 == 'l');
Relational:

(type1 == 'L'): Checks if type1 is 'L'.
(type1 == 'l'): Checks if type1 is 'l'.
Logical:

(type1 == 'L') || (type1 == 'l'): Combines the two relational expressions with a logical (||).

This calculation checks if type1 is either 'L' (uppercase) or 'l' (lowercase) and assigns the result (1 if true, 0 if false) .

3.Original: !(type1 == 'L' && cream1 == 'Y')

This checks if type1 is not 'L' or cream1 is not 'Y'.
Using DeMorgan’s Law: type1 != 'L' || cream1 != 'Y'

This logically negates both conditions and combines them with OR.
Both expressions are equivalent but the second one uses DeMorgan’s Law to simplify the negation.
